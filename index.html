        <p>There were 69 unprovoked shark attacks in 2023, 10 resulting in death. </p>

        <p>The number of cases in 2023 is in line with the past five-year global average of 63 incidents a year. While annual variations in shark-human interactions are predicted, the slight increase in fatalities did not ease people’s apprehension towards these creatures. </p>

        <p>In 2023, the United States accounted for 52% of shark attacks and 20% of the fatalities, according to my new analysis of data from the International Shark Attack File – a database headed by the University of Florida that tracks global shark attacks. Florida alone was responsible for 16 out of the 69 incidents globally. </p>

        <p>“Close to 60% of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a coast,” said Daniel Huber, a Florida-based shark expert who has had many appearances on Shark Week, National Geographic, and the Discovery Channel.  “Population grows over time, meaning it concentrates on coastlines over time. Statistically speaking, that is the primary driver of increased numbers of shark attacks over time.” </p>

        <p>Both Florida and Australia accounted for disproportionate amounts of shark attacks last year in comparison to other states and countries. Florida follows right behind California for the top two coastal populations, while over 80% of Australians live within the coastal zone. 

</p>

        <p>Living near coast lines often goes hand-in-hand with water-based activities, one of the most popular being surfing. Surfers and individuals participating in board sports were reported to be responsible for 42% of incidents, according to the Florida Museum. </p>


        <p>“Surfing is a human recreational activity that happens to make you particularly vulnerable to sharks. Sharks completely have the element of surprise in that scenario,” said Huber. “You are only aware of 180 degrees while on a board; underwater you can be aware of all 360.” </p>

        <p>The number of worldwide unprovoked shark attacks remains extremely low, but many people’s unwarranted fear of sharks remains high. Many times, individuals are victims to an “exploratory bite,” and not a predatory one. 

</p>

        <p>Huber says sharks may not intend to harm people when they encounter humans. Sharks may nudge or nibble simply to explore their surroundings. Their eyes cannot see around their mouth area, so sharks use their mouth to gather information, Huber said. The risk of falling victim to a shark attack is exceptionally rare.</p>

         <p>“You are close to five times more likely to be killed by an alligator, 2.5 times more likely to be killed by your neighbor's dog, and if we broaden it to natural hazards, you are 75 times more likely to die from a lightning strike than you are from a shark attack,” said Huber. </p>

          <p>Despite there being almost no evidence, the misconception that sharks intentionally hunt people still exists. Media propaganda plays a major role in this. Sharks fell victim to the Hollywood effect, and so did public perception. </p>

          <p> “This societal fear of sharks isn’t something that has existed forever. It is a product of the past 50 years and has a lot to do with the movie Jaws,” said Huber. “There are all these scenes in the first half of the movie where you see the power of the shark, you see something that represents the shark, without ever seeing the shark. Your imagination fills that space in, and I think that has a lot to do with how public perception changed.” </p>

          <p> Jaws, The Shallows, and Meters Down are just a few of the many movies that sensationalize sharks, praying on people’s fears for publicity and undeniably negatively affecting sharks. In the wake of the release of the first Jaws movie, catch and kill shark tournaments and exploitation by commercial fisheries increased while oceanic shark populations virtually collapsed, according to Huber. </p>

          <p> Steven Spielberg, Academy Award-winning filmmaker and director of Jaws, told BBC Radio in 2022 that he truly regrets the decimation of the shark population as a direct consequence of the book and film. </p>

          <p> Shark attacks on humans are proven to be very rare. However, they receive major media attention when they do occur. This amplifies the public's perception of sharks being mindless, vicious predators. Statistically, 69 unprovoked shark attacks worldwide in 2023 is an incredibly small number when compared to the number of yearly beachgoers. </p>

          <p> Humans often fail to see things through a rational lens. To provide an analogy, Huber explained that the majority of people are significantly more afraid of flying on a plane than getting in a car, despite air-travel being the safest form of transportation. Because the media clings to air-travel incidents, people form unwarranted fears. The same goes with shark attacks. </p>

          <p> Ten out of the 69 unprovoked shark attacks in 2023 were fatal, which is higher than the previous five-year annual global average, and yet the chances of one being attacked persists at a negligible level. </p>

          <p> “If you are a beach-goer in the United States, you have a one in 8-million chance of being attacked by a shark,” said Huber. “Those are really good odds.” </p>
